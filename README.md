Cellular Automaton with random symmetric rules and random Colors with pixi.js graphics

A rule is a mapping
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] -> {random color} 

[1][2][3]                                                                                  -
[8][X][4]                                                                                  -
[7][6][5]                                                                                  -

So there are 2^8 different values. To make it beautiful I added some symmetric attributes.
